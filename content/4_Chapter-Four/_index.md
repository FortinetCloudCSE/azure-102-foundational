title: "Chapter 4: Securing the VNET"
weight: 20
---





In this chapter, you will secure your VNET by deploying a FortiGate NVA, deploying a Route Table, and modifing the Route Table (User Define Route (UDR)), so the Linux VMs will send their traffic to the FortiGate for inspection and filtering.  The FortiGate will essentially become the default gateway for all traffic to/from the Linux VMs.
In Task four, five, and six, you will confirm Linux VM traffic through the FortiGate and create policies to manage the network traffic.

## Tasks to complete
- Task 1:  Deploy a FortiGate NVA
- Task 2:  Deploy a Route Table
- Task 3:  Create a UDR
- Task 4:  Confirm Linux VMs access via FortiGate
- Task 5:  Configure FortiGate Policy
- Task 6:  Confirm Managed Traffic
